/// This property wrapper offers a locking mechanism for accessing/mutating values in a safer
/// way. Bear in mind that operations such as `+=` or executions of `if let` to read and then
/// mutate  values are *unsafe*.  Each time you access the variable to read it, it acquires the lock,
/// then once the read is finished it releases it. The following operation is to mutate the value, which
/// requires the lock to be mechanism again, however, another thread may have already claimed the lock
/// in between these two operations and have potentially changed the value. This may cause unexpected
/// results or crashes.
/// In order to ensure you've acquired the lock for a certain amount of time use the `mutate` method.
